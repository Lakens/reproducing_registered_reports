### Instructions:
The RMarkdown file should be able to load the data file, which is: 

`Data_for_Analysis_of_Open_Data_and_Computational_Reproducibility_in_Registered_Reports_in_Psychology.xlsx`

as long as this datafile is in the same folder as the RMarkdown document. 
The code requires the here, irr, and readxl packages to be installed (for version numbers, see sessioninfo below).

The codebook is on the second tab of the excel file (the tab named 'codebook'). 
An overview of articles from the original zotero database that we excluded can be found on the 'excluded papers' tab.
